# Generative-Adversarial-Network-GAN-for-Image-Synthesis

This final term individual project focuses on the development of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize new images, which assigned as a comparative study between a baseline and a modified model architecture. The process began by loading and preprocessing a dataset of 1074 images extracted from a zip file. Two distinct GAN models which are the baseline and modified models were then developed and trained.  

On the training processes, the generator and discriminator models competed against each other, with the generator learning to produce increasingly realistic images. The performance of both models was evaluated carefully using the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric, where a lower FID score indicates a higher quality of generated images, meanwhile the higher it gets, the lower quality of the generated images. Through this in-depth analysis, the modified model shows its superiority by producing more realistic and higher-quality synthetic images, which was reflected in its lower FID score. The insights gained from this project are crucial for understanding the strengths of different GAN architectures in a real-world image synthesis scenario.
